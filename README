It was originally intended that the program would be an Android app, and we'd embed the phone in Bernie so he could flirt with the judges personally.  To this end, we had a fair amount of code specifically intended to troll the judges: "Judge me, judge name here!  Judge me hard!" or "Are you an item, judge name here?  Because you'd be worth all the points."
We didn't actually use it with Bernie, but we did receive full points.
